# Analysing Climate TRACE Emissions Inventory 
In September 2021, Climate TRACE, a coalition of climate-focused NGOs, technology companies, and universities, supported by former Vice President Al Gore, released the first Comprehensive, independent database of global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissinos. THe colation levarages the power cutting-edge technologies such as satellites, remote sensing, and advanced applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, to identify and track human-caused GHG emissions with unprecedented detail and speed.

The purpose of this project is analysing the emissions inventory, using Python and Jupyter Notebook. I have also used other sources, such as population and GDP data from the World Bank and GHG data from UNFCCC. You can find all the datasets in the folder "datasets".

Some of the analysed have been published in well-estabished platforms such as Towards Data Science. Below you can find the publications:
